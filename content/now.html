    <p>I am working at <a href="https://lambdalabs.com/">Lambda Labs</a> now, previously DigitalOcean.</p>
    <p>I married the most wonderful woman I've ever met, Mandi.</p>
    <p>Living in Wausau, Wisconsin.</p>
    <p>I still read lots, mostly fiction at this point to escape from the absurdity of this world by jumping into the absurdity of other worlds.</p>
    <p>I realized far too late that I have an unhealthy relationship with food.</p>
    <p>I exited the cult that is Mormonism many years ago, but far too late to undo the damage it caused in my life and the lives of those around me.</p>
